--In this SQL Code, I'm querying a database that's holding Netflix data across two databases: 
netflix_people and netflix_titles_info. 

--Questions are specific goals/objectives to find in the data. 

-- To join databases
SELECT 
people.show_id,
titles.title,
people.director
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
ON people.show_id = titles.show_id;


-- 1. To show how many movies (not TV shows) there are on the list
SELECT COUNT (*)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie';

-- 2. To show when the most recent media was added to Netflix

SELECT MAX (date(date_added))
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

-- 3. To display all movies and TV shows in alphabetical order

SELECT titles.title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
ORDER BY titles.title;

-- 4. To determine who the director for Bright Star is

SELECT 
titles.title,
people.director
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
ON people.show_id = titles.show_id
WHERE titles.title = 'Bright Star';

--5. To determine the oldest movie in the database, and when it was made

SELECT 
titles.title, 
titles.release_year
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
ORDER BY release_year
LIMIT 1;
